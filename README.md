# Alien Invasion - Trump/Hillary Edition
Space Invaders style 2D game created following along with Python Crash Course book, but with my own tweaks

Some of my updates include:
- Colors (background, text, bullets)
- Ship and alien images
- Ability to move up and down (instead of just left and right)
- Saved all time high score (the book's version would lose the high score every time game is closed)
- And more (I think) that I just don't remember
